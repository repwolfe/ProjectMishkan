// Project Mishkan Overview

A video game to build the Mishkan

Primarily for unaffiliated Jewish kids in North America

They play 'Elazar the Cohen' in charge of the all the Levis who build the Mishkan.

Like Age of Empires - setting pieces from above and the workers go ahead and do the building.

They can zoom down to ground level and walk around the Mishkan site as the Levis are putting things together.

As they approach a part of the Mishkan, a data sheet opens up displaying relevant pesukim and dimensions and some commentary.

Each level is one of the encampments of the Children of Israel during their forty years in the desert.

Prizes include: New models of parts of the Mishkan (ex. a Menorah according to Rashi)

As they progress through the game they can choose to mix and match and build their custom Mishkans which can then be screenshotted and shared.

Challenges could be: building against the clock (speed trials) and/or answering information (which they have to discover from within the Mishkan).
